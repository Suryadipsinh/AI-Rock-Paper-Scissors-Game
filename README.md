# AI-Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
This repository contains a Rock Paper Scissors Game. In which we can play Rock Paper Scissors game with AI. I used random library for making this game.

The Game:
Each player choses a move (simultaneously) from the choices:
rock, paper or scissors. 
If they chose the same move the game is a tie. Otherwise:
rock beats scissors
scissors beats paper
paper beats rock.

In this program a human plays against an AI. The AI choses randomly
(I promise). The game is repeated N_GAMES times and the human gets
a total score. Each win is worth +1 points, each loss is worth -1.
